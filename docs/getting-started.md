The Sbread and butter of any theme. Below you’ll find the layouts included with Minimal Mistakes, what they look like and the type of content they’ve been built for.

## Default Layout

The base layout all other layouts inherit from. There’s not much to this layout apart from pulling in several <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code>:

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Note:</strong> You won’t ever assign this layout directly to a post or page. Instead all other layouts will build off of it by setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout: default</code> in their YAML Front Matter.</p>

### Layout Based and User-Defined Classes

Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript. Perfect for “art directed” posts or adding custom styles to specific pages.
