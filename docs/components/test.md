<p>The Sbread and butter of any theme. Below you’ll find the layouts included with Minimal Mistakes, what they look like and the type of content they’ve been built for.</p>

<h2>Default Layout</h2>

<p>The base layout all other layouts inherit from. There’s not much to this layout apart from pulling in several <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code>:</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Note:</strong> You won’t ever assign this layout directly to a post or page. Instead all other layouts will build off of it by setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout: default</code> in their YAML Front Matter.</p>

<h3>Layout Based and User-Defined Classes</h3>

<p>Class names corresponding to each layout are automatically added to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> element eg. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body class="layout--single"&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript. Perfect for “art directed” posts or adding custom styles to specific pages.</p>
